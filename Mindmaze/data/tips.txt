Reframing tips (appears below prompt):
• Try “learning” language: “I’m still learning this, and practice helps.”
• Make it specific & actionable: “I’ll break the task into 3 steps.”
• Add evidence: “I delivered last week’s assignment on time.”
• Add self‑compassion: “It’s normal to feel this; I’ll pace myself.”
